			<p>Tuki is a Japanese singer and songwriter born on June 15, 2008. Her debut single "Bansanka" released in September 2023 took the top spot on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart on January 24, 2024, making her the youngest artist in the chart's history to surpass a 100 million views on streaming services.</p>
			<a href="https://tuki-official.net/" target="_blank"><h3>Biography</h3></a>
			<p>Tuki first started playing the guitar at the age of 13 and soon began uploading videos of performances of her original songs and covers on TikTok. When Tuki turned 15 years old; entering her first year as a high-school student, she released Bansanka. It was released independently by her label the Lunar Landing Plan on September 29, 2023. In January 2024, the song topped both the Oricon Combined Singles Chart and Billboard Japan Hot 100.</p>
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZpYEEcvu5I" target="_blank"><h3>Bansanka</h3></a>
			<p class>"Bansanka" was inspired after her father mentioned "There are about 30,000 days in a lifetime". Reflecting on that, she thought "I've already lived 5,000 days and only have about 25,000 more". On July 7, 2023, the chorus of an original song "Bansanka" was posted on TikTok without revealing its title. Subsequently, the first verse and bridge of the song were uploaded and on August 16, the chorus was reposted under the official title "Bansanka". The song became popular on TikTok, where it was used in various videos and covered by numerous users. On September 3, her official YouTube channel was opened.</p>
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeSKlyhYp9w" target="_blank"><h3>Honest Thoughts</h3></a>
			<p class="lastchild">Tuki is definitely an aspiring young artist that has lots of potential. Although as of now, out of all the songs she produced, only one song "Bansanka" has become a massive hit nearing 60 million views on YouTube. At this rate, it would seem that Tuki will just become a one-hit wonder as her other songs only gets a couple million views on YouTube. However, it should be taken into account that she is still in high-school and has to focus on several things in her life such as school/studies, friendships, her deep passion for music, and more. In the future, it is highly likely that she will pursue and focus mainly on music and produce more songs that would massively hit.</p>
